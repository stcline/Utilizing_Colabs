# :robot: Utilizing Colabs

## 🤓 In this breif assignment, you will learn how to use a form of Jupyter Notebooks called Google Colaboratory.  This will cover the basics about how to use Jupyter Notebooks with the built in Python environment. 

The goal of this lab assignment is to help you connect Colabs to your GitHub account and begin using it as a learning environment for this class. 🚀

## All we will do in this assignment is open the notebook file here in the repo, learn a little about what it is and run a few Python cells.

## 💻 Terms to know
* Jupyter Notebook
* Python environment

## 📝 Next steps
1. Open the file here titled, "Introduction_to_Notebooks.ipynb".  
2. Click the Open in Colab button.
3. Read through the document and test out the Python code blocks.
4. When you feel comfortable with the process, make a file here called "Observations.md" and explain, in your own words what Jupyter Notebooks are.
